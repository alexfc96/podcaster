## Project Description

**Podcaster** is a web application that allows users to search and explore a wide variety of podcasts from the Apple platform. Users can view detailed information about a specific podcast, including its episodes, and can also listen to the episodes directly on the platform.

## Technologies Used

The application has been developed using the following technologies:

- **React**: Used to create the user interface of the application.
- **TypeScript**: Used to manage the data interfaces of the application.
- **React Router Dom**: For navigation between different views of the application.
- **Material-UI**: Used for designing and styling components efficiently.
- **LocalStorage**: To cache podcast data and minimize API calls.
- **iTunes API**: Used to retrieve real-time podcast data.

## How to Deploy the Application

To deploy the application in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Start the application with `npm run dev`.

## How to Use the Application

1. When the application is up and running, you will see a list of popular podcasts on the homepage.

2. You can use the search bar to find specific podcasts by title or keyword.

3. Click on a podcast to view detailed information and a list of its episodes.

4. Click on an episode to see more details and listen to it directly on the application.

## Additional Features for the future

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application is fully responsive on different devices and screen sizes.

- **Category System**: Add categories to effectively organize podcasts.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of the application, we encountered the following challenges:

- **Cache Data Management**: Designing an efficient strategy to cache podcast data and ensure that it remains up-to-date.

- **Data Loading Time**: Maximizing data loading time by applying a delay to display the spinner in the Header Component when data is coming from the API.
